Scenario: Testing the new user registration interface
Goal: Identify unexpected behaviors, usability issues and functional errors

Exploratory session:
1- Open the "Register" page (expected fields and max sizes: Name (50), E-mail (100), Username (20), Password)
2- Attempt to insert numbers and special characters into the "Name" field
3- Attempt to enter an invalid e-mail
4- Enter more characters than allowed in the fields to check validation limits
5- Leave the "Password" field empty
6- Click the "Register" button multiple times to check the response

Findings:
1- The system allows more than 50 characters in the "Name" field
2- Submitting the form without a password results in a 500 Internal Server Error
3- Multiples clicks in the "Register" button leads to records with the same data
