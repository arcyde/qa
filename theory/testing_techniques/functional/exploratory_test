Exploratory testing is a type of test performed by using the system or functionality under development, without predefined test cases or scripts. It can be classified as a black-box or grey-box technique, depending on how much knowledge the tester has. In exploratory testing, learning and execution happen simultaneously, requiring analytical and critical-thinking skills. Because it does not follow structured steps or a formal plan, tracking the exact actions taken and reproducing issues can be more challenging.
